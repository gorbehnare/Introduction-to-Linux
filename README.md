# Introduction to Linux Topics
This site contains material that is a shorter version of the official introductory course "Linux Systems Administration". Not all course material is included. 
The material is subject to errors and omissions, as this material is not intended to be official in any capacity, however, I hope this may be useful as a quick reminder or review.
